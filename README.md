# text-editor-practice

This repository will contain my coding practice, making a text editor
from scratch.

I based this practice from this wonderful resource: [Build Your Own Text Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html).

For the time being, I am going to stick with the instructions there while
learning how to make this text editor.

When I do finish making this text editor according to the resource, I want to
make this text editor more useful with more functionality and customizability.
I wish this text editor could be somewhat similar to vi / vim, but we'll see.

## Building

You can build this project provided that you have a C compiler such as
`gcc` or `clang` or `tcc` and the like and also `make`

The project isn't going to need external libs. The project is supposed
to use only the standard C libs.
